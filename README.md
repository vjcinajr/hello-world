# hello-world
Introducing myselfâ€¦
I am a retired computer scientist and IT professional.
I do my best to keep up with technology improvements - especially related to computing - including user interfaces, programming and the the best way to use new systems capabilities.
I like helping friends and family with technology - giving advice, answering questions, solving problems and showing people how to get the most out of their devices.
